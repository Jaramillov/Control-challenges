## About this repository

This repository contains the solutions to the challenge assignments (*retos*) from the Control Systems course at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Each reto includes a written report (PDF) along with the corresponding MATLAB scripts and Simulink models used to obtain and verify the results.

The course covers the fundamental methods for analysis and design of closed-loop control systems, from stability theory to frequency-domain and state-space design techniques.

---

## Topics covered

- Stability analysis (Routh-Hurwitz criterion)
- System and signal handling, block diagram algebra
- Steady-state error analysis
- Transient response analysis
- Algebraic control system design
- Root Locus method
- Frequency-domain design (lead, lag, and lead-lag compensators)
- State-space design
